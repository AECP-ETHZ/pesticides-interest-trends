#### Title: R-Code: Download, Analysis and Visualization of Google Trends Data of Pesticide and Popular Initiative related search terms

We provide here the R-code for reproducing Schaub et al (2020). 


The code allows to: 
i) download Google Trends data used in the analysis
ii) estimate structural breaks
iii) visualize results

 
The code is structured into 
1) a script for downloading and first preparation of Google Trends data (‘pesticide_trends_data_download.R’)
2) a script for further data preparation as well as analysis and visualization of data (‘pesticide_trends_data_preparation_analysis_visualization.R’),
